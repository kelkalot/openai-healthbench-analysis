# In-Depth Analysis of OpenAI's HealthBench ü©∫üìä

This repository contains code and resources related to an in-depth analysis of **OpenAI's HealthBench**, a benchmark designed for evaluating Large Language Models in the healthcare sector.

OpenAI's Announcement: [HealthBench Index](https://openai.com/index/healthbench/)

This analysis looks closely into the benchmark's data, providing insights into its structure, nuances, and implications for evaluating AI in healthcare.

## üîë Key Insights from the Analysis

My in-depth analysis of HealthBench's data shows a robust framework with specific characteristics that users and developers should consider:

* **Conversation Structure:** While designed for multi-turn interactions (averaging 2.6 turns), a notable **58.3% of conversations are single-turn**, emphasizing comprehensive initial responses.
* **Rubric Emphasis:** Evaluation is guided by an average of 11.4 criteria per example, with a **leaning towards positive reinforcement (69.3% positive criteria)**. Criteria text length averages 40.7 words but can extend up to 481 words.
* **Thematic Focus:** The dataset shows concentrations in themes like **‚Äúglobal_health‚Äù (21.9%) and ‚Äúhedging‚Äù (21.4%)**, which may influence overall model performance insights.
* **Internal Criteria Consistency:** An exploration of textual similarity within individual examples found an average cosine similarity of 0.090 between criteria pairs. However, **642 examples (12.8%) contained at least one pair of criteria with high similarity (‚â•0.8)**, suggesting potential for evaluative overlap.
* **‚ÄúHard‚Äù Examples:** The 1,000 ‚ÄúHealthBench Hard‚Äù examples maintain a similar average number of criteria but show shifts in thematic distribution and subtle differences in criteria point distributions, indicating difficulty likely stems from nuanced requirements.
* **Initial Prompt Integrity:** A first-turn content classification analysis revealed that while most prompts initiate with relevant content, **a subset begins with clearly non-medical or inappropriate material**. This highlights the importance of inspecting prompt origins. (Resulting dataset and code for this specific analysis are shared below).

This detailed examination aims to provide a nuanced understanding of HealthBench‚Äôs construction, helping the community to interpret its results more effectively and advance the development of safer, more reliable AI in healthcare. *For a more detailed discussion, please see the full analysis [TODO: Link to your blog post/paper if you have one, otherwise remove this sentence or rephrase]*.
